1) **Problem**: Web3 UX forces users to think in transactions. People want to state goals (swap/bridge/mint) not low-level steps.
2) **Our Approach**: An intent-centric builder that captures *what* the user wants + their constraints (slippage, privacy).
3) **Routing**: A planner composes multi-chain steps automatically (e.g., Ethereum → Anoma matching → Osmosis).
4) **Privacy**: Users choose public or shielded; the router adds a matching step that respects this.
5) **Demo**: Create intent → see route → simulate execution → receive tx hashes.
6) **Impact**: Faster onboarding, fewer errors, portable intents across chains.
7) **Next**: Plug real adapters/SDKs; add reputation & MEV-aware matching.
