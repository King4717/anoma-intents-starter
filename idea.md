# Detailed Prototype Idea: Intent-Based Subscriptions

## Problem
Traditional Web3 subscriptions are cumbersome:
- Users must approve recurring payments manually.
- Missing payments stop services.
- Cross-chain subscriptions are nearly impossible without bridging complexities.

## Solution
**Anoma Intents** let users set recurring payments once. The system automatically executes payments according to user-defined intent:
- Cross-chain execution
- Flexible frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Easy cancellation

## User Flow
1. User selects a subscription service (DAO, NFT platform, content creator).  
2. User sets payment intent (amount + frequency).  
3. Anoma protocol tracks and executes the intent automatically.  
4. Notifications for payments, successful or failed, are sent to the user.

## Benefits
- Hassle-free recurring payments
- No missed payments
- One-time setup
- Fully decentralized, privacy-preserving

## Mockup
